# EE6380_Project
 Through this project, we explore the domain of self supervised learning in Computer Vision </br>
 We experiment with the [DINO](https://ai.meta.com/blog/dino-paws-computer-vision-with-self-supervised-transformers-and-10x-more-efficient-training/) model from Meta AI. We also experiment with BYOL
 We also experiment on certain down stream tasks
